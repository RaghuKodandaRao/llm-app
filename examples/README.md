Visualize your Path way LLM Generative responses as a Knowegde Graph

A Knowegde Graph is a visual representation of Entities like Names, organizations etc as nodes connected with edges having labels.  

In this exercise I have extended the Pathway LLM application to post the response text recived from the LLM to generate the Knwoedge graph. I promted the LLM app to "tell me something", "tell me a story", etc to generate some text, the output of the same are captured as below

The UI as well is extended to show a "Hide Graph" button to hide the graph, an output is as below
