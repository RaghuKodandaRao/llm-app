<b><h1>Visualize Pathway LLM Generative AI responses as a Knowlegde Graph</h1></b>

A Knowlegde Graph is a visual representation in the form of Graph consisting of Entities like Names, organizations etc formulated as nodes. These nodes are connected with edges having labels, that often depict information or ralation between nodes like Action or association words.  

In this exercise I have extended the Pathway LLM application to post the response text recived from the LLM to generate the Knwoedge graph. I promted the LLM app to "tell me something", "tell me a story", etc to generate some text, the output of the same are captured as below

The UI as well is extended to show a "Hide Graph" button to hide the graph, the below sample shows the LLM Output ext while the graph is hidden as the user has clicked the"Hide Graph" button.
